Game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard
 
  Hello, this was my first project for my programming class in engineering's first semester at my school (Insper). The task given 
to me was to make a very simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. If you don't know what is this game, consult this
Wikipedia article to know what I am talking about (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#Additional_weapons). 
The game is equal to the old game Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with new features.

  In the game I made, you need to 'battle' the computer, and who reaches 3 points wins. Everytime anyone wins a round, earns 
a point. If the oponent wins a round and you have points, you lose one point, unless if your scoreboard is 0 pts.In this case you
don't lose pts (remains 0tps). For example:
    If you already have 2 points and the computer (with 0 point currently) wins a round, you lose one point, so the scoreboard
  would be 1 point for you and the computer would have 1 point and vice-versa. 

  The newer the commit, it will be a revision of the past version of the program.
